## Overview

**BERT** (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a pre-trained natural language processing model proposed by Google, widely used in various natural language processing tasks. BERT captures contextual relationships between words by pre-training on large-scale corpora, achieving excellent results in many tasks.

In this task, we will use the BERT model to classify IMDB movie reviews into "positive" or "negative" sentiments.

The **IMDB movie review dataset** contains 50,000 movie reviews, divided into 25,000 training and 25,000 test data, each with 50% positive and 50% negative reviews. We will use the pre-trained BERT model to fine-tune these reviews for sentiment classification.

## Environment Setup

This example is based on `Python>=3.8`. Please ensure Python is installed on your computer. Environment dependencies:

```txt
transformers
datasets
swanlab
```

Quick installation command:

```bash
pip install transformers datasets swanlab
```

> The code in this article is tested with transformers==4.41.0, datasets==2.19.1, swanlab==0.3.3

## Complete Code

```python
"""
Fine-tune a pre-trained BERT model on the IMDB dataset and use the SwanLabCallback callback function to upload the results to SwanLab.
The IMDB dataset labels 1 as positive and 0 as negative.
