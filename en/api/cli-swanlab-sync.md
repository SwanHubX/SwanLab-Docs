```bash
swanlab sync [options] [logdir]
```

| Option | Description |

| `-w`, `--workspace` | The workspace for syncing logs. If not specified, the default workspace will be used. |
| `-p`, `--project` | The project for syncing logs. If not specified, the default project will be used. |
| `-i`, `--id` | The experiment ID to sync the logs to. It can only be used when the path is a single directory. For more details, see [#1194](https://github.com/SwanHubX/SwanLab/pull/1194). |

## Introduction

Sync local logs to SwanLab cloud or private deployment.

## Version Comparison

> The version comparison only applies to the `swanlab sync` command. For the Python library version comparison, please refer to [Python Library Version Comparison](./cli-swanlab-sync.md#python-library-version-comparison).

| swanlab library version | Feature | Supported log files |
| --- | --- | --- |
| >=0.6.8 | Support syncing logs from abnormal terminal of training; support `id` parameter | Logs generated by `>=0.6.8` version of swanlab library |
| <0.6.8 | - | Logs generated by `<0.6.8` version of swanlab library |

## Command Line Examples

Locate the log directory you want to upload to the cloud (by default, it's the `run-` prefixed directory under `swanlog`), then execute the command:

```bash
swanlab sync ./swanlog/run-xxx
```

::: info
By default, logs will be synced to the `project` recorded in the log files, which is the `project` set when running the experiment.  
If you want to sync to a different project, you can use the `-p` option to specify the project.
:::

If you see the following output, it indicates a successful sync:

![swanlab sync](./cli-swanlab-sync/console.png)

## Python Code Example

```python
import swanlab

swanlab.login(api_key="Your API Key")

swanlab.sync(
    dir_path="./swanlog/run-xxx",
    workspace="swanlab",
    project_name="sync_test",
)
```

## Batch Upload

```bash
swanlab sync ./swanlog/run-*
```
