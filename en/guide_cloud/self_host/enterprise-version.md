# Team/Enterprise Version

The private individual edition (free) currently supports the majority of the features available in the public cloud edition. However, it does not include advanced functionalities such as multi-user collaboration, organization creation, permission control, statistical dashboards, etc.

For partners interested in the Team Edition, Enterprise Edition, or Multi-Tenant Cloud Edition, please feel free to contact us at: [contact@swanlab.cn](mailto:contact@swanlab.cn). Kindly include your company/institution and position in your message.
