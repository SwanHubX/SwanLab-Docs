# System Hardware Monitoring (Supports Ascend)

During the tracking of experiments, SwanLab **automatically monitors** the hardware resources of the machine and records them in the **"System" charts**.

Currently, SwanLab supports monitoring hardware resources for three types of **AI computing chips** (**Huawei Ascend** 、**NVIDIA** 、**Cambricon**), covering metrics such as GPU utilization, VRAM usage, GPU temperature, and GPU power consumption.

In addition, SwanLab also supports monitoring hardware resources such as **CPU**, **memory**, and **disk**.

## Detailed System Monitoring Metrics  

SwanLab automatically monitors hardware resource utilization on the machine running the experiment and generates charts for each metric, collectively displayed in the **"System" charts** tab.  

### **Sampling Strategy & Frequency**  
SwanLab dynamically adjusts hardware data sampling frequency based on experiment duration to balance data granularity and system performance. Sampling frequencies are tiered as follows:  

| Data Points Collected | Sampling Frequency |  
|:---------------------:|:------------------:|  
| 0~10                  | Every 10 seconds   |  
| 10~50                 | Every 30 seconds   |  
| 50+                   | Every 60 seconds   |  

SwanLab monitors GPU, NPU, CPU, system memory, disk I/O, and network metrics—all critical to the training process. Below is a detailed breakdown of each monitoring category and its visualization significance.
