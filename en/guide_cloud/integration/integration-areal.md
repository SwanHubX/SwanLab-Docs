# AREAL  

[AReaL](https://github.com/inclusionAI/AReaL) (Ant Reasoning RL) is an open-source, fully asynchronous reinforcement learning training system developed by the Reinforcement Learning Lab (RL Lab) at Ant Research. It is designed for large-scale reasoning models. Based on the open-source project [RealHF](https://github.com/openpsi-project/ReaLHF), this system is committed to open-sourcing by providing training details, data, and the necessary infrastructure for reproducing results, along with the model itself.
